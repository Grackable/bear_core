<p><strong>Remove Reference after Build</strong>: Will remove the reference after a build process. The build data is stored in maya files which are being referenced when building them, for instance guides or deformation. Keeping the reference in the scene after building will allow you to do custom transfers to your rig if needed, for example when you want to transfer weights from or to specific joints using joint labeling. In this case you can modify the joint labels in the referenced rig to make custom skin weight transfers.</p>
<p><strong>Use Custom Delivery Saving</strong>: You have the option to use a custom saving method for the <em>Save Delivery</em> option in the <em>File</em> menu. Once activated, the system will run the script defined in <em>Delivery Script </em>under the <em>Global Scripts</em> rollout from the <em>BEAR Builder Settings</em>.</p>
