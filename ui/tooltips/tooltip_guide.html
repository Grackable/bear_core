<p>The <strong>Guide</strong> build step creates the guide nodes for components.</p>
<p>If you change component settings, rebuild the guide to reflect the changes in the scene.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the <em>Build</em> tab, choose <em>Selected Components</em> or <em>All Components</em> to choose which guide components you like to build.</p>
<p><strong>Side</strong> building is used to create a side component out of an existing component, essentially mirroring guides.</p>
<p><strong>Inactive</strong>: Builds the sides according to the component settings.</p>
<p><strong>Right</strong>: If a left-side component is selected, a mirrored right-side component will be built. Choose <em>Selected Components</em> at the bottom of the <em>Build</em> tab. If you choose <em>All Components</em>, the right side mirrored from all left-side components will be built.</p>
<p><strong>Left</strong>: According to <strong>Right</strong>.</p>
<p>The face components ignore side building. They always build the left side for the guide and both sides for the rig.</p>
<p>If you wish to import guides from an external asset or the same asset (essentially duplicating components), activate <em>From Asset</em> in the lower section of the <em>Build</em> tab. This allows importing guides using the <em>Guide Picker</em> that will show up once you click <em>Build</em>.</p>
<p>Loading guides requires a guide file to be saved under <em>File -> Save Guide</em>.</p>
