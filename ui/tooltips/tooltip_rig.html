<p>The <strong>Rig</strong> build step builds the rig based on the guide in the scene.</p>
<p>The order of the guide components in the outliner define the order of which rig components are built. If a parent of a component doesn't exist in the scene yet, a placeholder node will be created.</p>
<p>Choose between <em>All Components</em> and <em>Selected Components</em> at the bottom of the <em>Build</em> tab.</p>
