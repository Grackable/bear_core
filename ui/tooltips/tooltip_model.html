<p>The <strong>Model</strong> build step imports the model and replaces the existing.</p>
<p>This build step is optional since it depends on your workflow or pipeline requirements. Using this build step requires either the model file to be located in the BEAR asset folder or a custom script for the model build step.</p>
<p>If you wish to move your model file to the BEAR asset folder, open your model in Maya and save it using the <em>Save Model</em> option in the <em>File</em> menu.</p>
<p>A <em>Model Script</em> can be assigned under <em>Global Scripts</em> in the <em>BEAR Builder Settings</em>. This custom script would handle the model import from any location specified by your pipeline.</p>
